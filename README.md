# Mapping Latent Power

## A Synthetic Portraiture Feature Taxonomy

This repository accompanies the research project "Mapping the Latent Image: Analyzing Representational Power and Harm in Synthetic Portraits". 
The project is spearheaded by Dr. D.S. Martinez Pandiani at the University of Amsterdam. Collaborators include: Dalila Menhebi, Emily Klein, Lux Voorzanger. 
It provides tools, resources, and data for studying how AI-generated images encode aesthetic, affective, and compositional cues that reflect (colonial) cultural hierarchies and social norms.

### Purpose

Generative image models not only depict subjects, but also encode subtle, unprompted visual–affective cues—such as gaze, posture, gesture, and expression—that shape perceptions of vulnerability, desirability, and social hierarchy. This repository provides tools to help researchers systematically investigate these mechanisms, offering reproducible methods for analyzing representational power beyond demographic presence in synthetic imagery.

### Contents

The repository includes:

- Feature Taxonomy: A structured list of 157 visual–affective features identified in our study, including definitions and coding guidelines.

- Highlighted Features: Eight recurrent features with clear representational stakes, illustrated with examples.

- Annotation Guidelines: Instructions for manually labeling synthetic images according to the taxonomy.

- Starter Python Code: Scripts to facilitate analysis of annotated data, including basic data handling and visualization tools.

### Usage

Researchers can use these tools, under the terms of the license and appropriate citation, to:

- Apply the taxonomy to new datasets of synthetic images.

- Conduct manual or automated annotation of visual–affective features.

- Explore the aesthetic, affective, and compositional dimensions of representational power in generative visual culture.

- Build upon or extend the taxonomy and methodology for further academic research.
